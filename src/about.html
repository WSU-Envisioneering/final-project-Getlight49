  <img src="images/download.jpg" alt="Me">
  <p>My name is Seth Shaw I am going into 11th grade. I have worked hard to take summer classes or online classes throughout the school year. This ensures I will have more room in my schedule for Weber State classes and Davis Technical College. I want to be an electrician this means I can go Davis Technical College for 4 years in order to get certified in this field. I also will be earning my associateâ€™s degree at Weber State at the same time. This is my plan for now and I look forward to working in a career field that I get to explore electricity that I find so interesting. I also have a passion for computer science and STEM so I will continue to gain knowledge and grow this part of my interest as well. I will do this by taking CE classes in high school and hopefully be part of the enisioneering summer program once again.</p>
