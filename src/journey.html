    <p>This class taught me how to do HTML and CSS. I knew a little about HTML, but nothing compared to what Mrs. Murphy and others taught me. This class was tougher than I thought it was going to be honestly. I found it challenging but was able to understand concepts with time. Learning how websites and colors play a huge role in website design. Thinking of phones before desktop when designing a website was something I never gave much thought to. I saw how this was extremely beneficial and made so much sense once learning about it. I know I personally get frustrated when I look something up on my phone and the website wasnâ€™t made for phone and it is hard to find things or things that are cut off. This class helped me think about design and planning in a world wide web and internet mindset more than ever before.</p>
